# Workflow Editor Guide

The **Editor** is the workspace where you construct AI generation pipelines.

## Core Concepts

### Nodes
A **Node** is a functional block.
-   **Model Nodes**: Generate content (e.g., Flux Pro, Stable Diffusion, Nano Banana).
-   **Input Nodes**: Provide data (e.g., Prompt, Image Upload).
-   **Tool Nodes**: Modify content (e.g., Upscale, Inpaint, Remove Background).

### Edges
**Edges** (wires) connect nodes. Data flows from **Left/Top** (Outputs) to **Right/Bottom** (Inputs).
-   Connect a **Prompt** node to a **Model** node to control what it generates.
-   Connect a **Model** node to an **Upscale** node to enhance the result.

## Interface Tour

### 1. The Canvas
-   **Pan**: Click & Drag on empty space.
-   **Zoom**: Mouse Wheel / Trackpad pinch.
-   **Context Menu**: Right-click anywhere to quickly add nodes.

### 2. The Sidebar (Left)
Contains the library of available nodes, categorized by type:
-   **Models**: Image Gen (Flux, SD3.5, Imagen 4) & Video Gen (Veo, Runway, Luma).
-   **Tools**: Editing utilities (Inpaint, Upscale, Blur).
-   **My Media**: Your personal gallery of uploaded and generated assets.

### 3. The Header (Top)
-   **Project Title**: Click to rename.
-   **Run / Stop Button**: Execute or Cancel your workflow.
-   **Credit Balance**: Displays your current available credits.
-   **Outputs**: View a history of your recent generations.

### 4. The Assistant Dock (Bottom)
A natural language AI helper.
-   Type: *"Create a workflow that generates a cyberpunk city and then upscales it."*
-   Result: The AI will automatically place and connect the required nodes for you.

## Working with Media

### My Media Gallery
The **My Media** tab in the sidebar gives you access to:
-   **Uploads**: Images you have uploaded via the "Image Upload" node.
-   **Generations**: Every image generated by an AI model is automatically saved here.
-   **Drag & Drop**: You can drag any image from the gallery directly onto the canvas to create a new node with that image pre-loaded.

### Persistent Storage
All your assets are stored permanently. You can access them anytime, even in future sessions.

## Running a Workflow

### Execution
1.  Ensure all required inputs (like Prompts) are connected or filled in.
2.  **Global Run**: Click "Run" in the top bar to execute the entire flow. The system will intelligently run only the nodes that need updating.
3.  **Node Run**: Click "Generate" on a specific node to run just that node and its dependencies.

### Stopping
If a workflow is taking too long or you made a mistake:
-   Click the **Stop** button (which replaces the Run button during execution).
-   This immediately halts the process and stops credit consumption for pending steps.

### Smart Caching
If a node has already run successfully and its inputs haven't changed, the editor will **reuse the cached output** instead of re-running the model. This saves you time and credits!

## Node Settings
Select a node or look for the gear icon to access advanced settings:
-   **Aspect Ratio**: Change dimensions (Landscape, Portrait, Square).
-   **Guidance Scale**: How closely the model follows the prompt.
-   **Seed**: Fixed number for reproducible results.
